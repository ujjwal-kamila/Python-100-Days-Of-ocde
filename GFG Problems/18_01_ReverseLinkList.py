# Problem: Reverse a Linked List
# Given the head of a linked list, the task is to reverse this list and return the reversed head.


# Input: A singly linked list with nodes: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None
# Output: The reversed linked list: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> None

'''
Approach:
Use two pointers (prev and curr):
prev: Tracks the previous node (initially None).
curr: Tracks the current node (starts at head).
For each node:
Save the next node in a temporary variable (next_node).
Reverse the current nodeâ€™s pointer (curr.next = prev).
Move prev to the current node (prev = curr) and move curr to next_node.
Repeat until all nodes are reversed (curr becomes None).
The new head of the list is prev (previous node after reversal).
