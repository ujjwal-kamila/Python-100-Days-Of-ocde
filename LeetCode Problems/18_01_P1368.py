# 1368. Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid

# Problem Overview:
# You are given a grid where each cell has an arrow directing to one of the four adjacent cells.
# Moving in the direction the arrow points doesnâ€™t cost anything (0-cost), but if you change the direction to go to the next cell, it incurs a cost (1-cost).


# 0-1 BFS Approach: In this method.......Use BFS for grid traversal.
# Use a deque (double-ended queue) to process 0-cost movements first by adding them to the front and 1-cost movements to the back. This allows processing the grid with priority for cheaper paths.

# Time Complexity: O(m*n)
# Space Complexity: O(m*n)

        # Initialize minCost array with infinity

                        else:
                            dq.appendleft((nr, nc))  # Add to front
